@section Description

This package adds additional Subversion support commands, similar to
the P4::C4 package.  These commands let you apply .cvsignore or
.gitignore files, snapshot areas and cleanup ignored files. You can
also create views that consist of different repository areas, and deal
with them as if it was a larger checkout.

@section Known Bugs

SVN::S4 relys on some obscure features of Subversion, in that s4 needs
to modify the .svn directory to create empty directories and svn
externals that switch to them.  This has only been tested on
Subversion 1.1 and 1.2, newer versions will probably require patching.

@node Supported Systems, Installation, Known Bugs, Top
@section Supported Systems

This version of SVN::S4 has been built and tested on:

@itemize @bullet
@item i386-linux
@end itemize

It should run on any Unix system with appropriate releases of
Subversion (see above).  Minor porting may be required for Windows
systems.
